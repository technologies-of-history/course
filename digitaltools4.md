## Mapping History

You’ve already explored [Google MyMaps](https://www.google.com/maps) in your second Digital Tools assignment. Now, for your fourth Digital Tools Assignment, you will use a different mapping tool to create 
a visual and spatial historical narrative. [ArcGIS Online](http://tcugis.maps.arcgis.com) is a more robust platform for encoding information onto a geographical framework. For this assignment, you'll georeference an early printed map from [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/) and link geospatial data on a singular voyage of discovery (gathered from the [Age of Exploration](https://resources.amdigital.co.uk/aoe/map/) site) by creating and sharing your own ArcGIS Story Map.

## Step 1: Choose a Voyage Dataset & Find a Historical Map

1. Select a dataset of voyage coordinates and dates relating to one early modern voyage (between 1450 and 1800) from the [Age of Exploration](https://resources.amdigital.co.uk/aoe/map/) site. You'll select your dataset from the **.csv** file that appears when you click **Dowload Data** at the top right of the [Age of Exploration](https://resources.amdigital.co.uk/aoe/map/) site.
2. Right click the webpage and click **Save As...**. Save the file somewhere on your computer, making sure you add **.csv** to the end of the filename.
3. Double check that you've created the file correctly by opening the **.csv** file you created (in Excel or Google sheets). Once the file is open, you can delete all the data you **don't** need, keeping only the coordinates and dates for your chosen voyage.
4. Now that your dataset is selcted, visit [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/) to find a historical map that matches the region and era of your voyage. For example, if you've selected Captain Cook's first voyage, you might want to find a map of Polynesia and Australia from the early 1800s.
5. You can find a map that fits the bill by using the bottom timeline slider to adjust the era of map you're looking for, and then changing the map view to focus on the area of the globe you'd like to see maps for. Make sure the map you choose is from the **David Rumsey Collection** (you can tell because you'll see the black box with the David Rumsey logo next to the map image.)
6. After finding a map to work with in [Open Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/), navigate to [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com) and copy-and-paste the title of the map you've selected into the search box. You'll be able to see the full title of your chosen map if you click the **Document** button at the far right of the menu directly above the map.
7. Once you've located your map on the [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com), click **Export** at the top right and select **Extra Large**. You'll get a folder with a **.jpg** file and a **.txt** file. You don't need the **.txt** file, but save the **.jpg** file somewhere you'll remember on your computer.

## Step 2: Georeference your chosen map with ArcGIS

1. Log into [ArcGIS Online](http://tcugis.maps.arcgis.com) and click **Map** in the top menu.
2. Click the **plus sign** at the top left and select **Add Media Layer.** Drop and drop the downloaded **.jpg** file of your chosen historical map into the box.
3. Once your image loads, your historical map will appear over the base layer world map. You now have the opportunity to align it with the base map, roughly georeferencing it for future use.
4. You'll have the option to move the image around, resize it, and even rotate it, if necessary. You can play with the transparency slider so you can see both the historical map and base layer to line them up.
5. Once you get the map roughly where you want it, at the bottom left, click **Side-by-Side** to create a set of georeferenced points. Essentially, you'll place each of the four points in exactly the same spot on both maps. This will warp the map to more accurately create a georeferenced layer.

Once you've got your georeferenced map saved, you can move on to create your StoryMap.
