## Mapping History

You’ve already explored [Google MyMaps](https://www.google.com/maps) in your second Digital Tools assignment.

Now, for your fourth Digital Tools Assignment, you will use a different mapping tool to create 
a visual and spatial historical narrative. You will use a sixteenth-century map that has
been "warped" to match contemporary longitude and latitude to tell this story. This will involve using 
"MapWarper," a digital tool for enabling GIS manipulation of historical maps. You'll also use a dataset pulled from the Age of Exploration database.

## Instructions:

[StoryMaps](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) is a free tool to help you tell stories on the web that highlight the locations of a series of events. It's free to use with a Google drive account. You simply upload images, or link to images from the web, that you then connect to points on a map. You can make changes to the map schema, fonts, and color and layout. Before beginning your StoryMap, you may want to take a look at the gallery of [examples](https://storymap.knightlab.com/#examples) on the StoryMaps site. When you complete your StoryMap you'll embed your StoryMap into a blog post using Markdown and GitHub, as usual.

The StoryMap element of this assignment is just the beginning. For this project, you'll use 

## Instructions for Submission:

1. Create your StoryMap.
2. Either directly in our GitHub repository in the branch draft-posts or in your text editor create a new Markdown file with the naming conventions we've practiced in your first Digital Tools Assignment (YYYY-MM-DD-Post Title.md).
3. Write a 4–5 paragraph post answering the questions listed above. Write well and clearly! Think of this as equivalent to a 1-2 page response paper.
4. Copy the HTML embed code that appears when you "share" your Story Map or TimeMapper.
5. Paste the HTML embed code into your Markdown file at a point in your writing that makes sense.
6. Create a **New Branch** in our course repository. Click the arrow to the right of **master** in the branch menu, and in the search box type in the name of the new branch you'll create: **yourname-storymaps**. Click the option that appears that says **Create branch: yourname-storymaps**.
7. Upload your post into the **posts** folder of the new branch, **Commit** your changes, and create a **Pull Request** to merge it with the **master** branch of our repository. **Pay attention** and be sure you select the right **head** for your request.


Ok, that's it! You've done it!
