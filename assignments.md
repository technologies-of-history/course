## Digital Tools Assignment #1: Communicating Simply

In this assignment, students will produce a blog post reflecting on how the nature of a communication technology informs the structures of knowledge that it can communicate. Students will write about the emergence of writing systems in the ancient world in relation to the development of “simple” or “static” communications technologies for digital scholarship. Students will produce this assignment using those simple digital tools: in Markdown syntax, for publication on our Hugo-run course site, hosted through our course GitHub, thus demonstrating mastery of foundational digital skills. In addition, students will demonstrate that they recognize the significant differences among different forms of ancient writing systems developed across the ancient Mediterranean and ancient China.

## Digital Tools Assignment #2: Showing History

In this assignment, students will produce a blog post that reflects on the presence of public writing—in this case, Roman epigraphy—as a marker of complex civilization. Using epigraphic data from the Heidelberg database, students will create a static post discussing at least four surviving artifacts of Roman epigraphy. This post will include an embedded Google MyMaps with the modern location of these artifacts, as well as an embedded IIIF viewer so that users can compare epigraphic images side-by-side.

## Digital Tools Assignment #3: Making Text into Data

In this assignment, students will produce a TEI-encoded transcription of a medical recipe from a fifteenth-century manuscript as a means of understanding the relationship between writing and doing in the early modern world. Students will contribute their transcription to an XML file in our course GitHub repository, which the class will then publish using the digital publication tool, EditionCrafter. Each student will also be responsible for producing a brief blog post describing the materials and methods represented in their medical recipe.

## Digital Tools Assignment #4: Mapping History

In this assignment, students will produce a blog post reflecting on how maps are interpretive pieces of communication that reflect cultural assumptions, much like travel narratives or ethnographies. The blog post will feature an interactive StoryMap made with a geocoded and “warped” 1569 map of the world by Gerard Mercator. This StoryMap should present geospatial data on one of the major late fifteenth- or sixteenth-century voyages of European exploration drawn from the Age of Exploration database. Students will produce a narrative post explaining how their selected voyage brought different cultures into contact, and how that contact left its imprint on the geopolitical boundaries we see on the contemporary globe today.

## Digital Tools Assignment #5: Networks and Knowledge

In this assignment, students will produce a blog post analyzing the communications network of an early modern correspondent, selected from the database Early Modern Letters online. This post will include a visualization of their letter writer’s communications network using Palladio, a network analysis and data visualization tool produced by the Stanford Humanities + Design Lab. The blog post should also contain a description and historical contextualization of at least three of the correspondent’s letters, accessed through Early Modern Letters Online. Finally, students should articulate how these historical documents illustrate the extent to which the history of Enlightenment ideas is also a history of social interaction and exchange.
